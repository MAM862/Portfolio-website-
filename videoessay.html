    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The video essay critiques the U.S. tipping system, examining its flaws and advocating for a fair-wage model. 
        It highlights how tipping creates wage instability, with workers earning unpredictable incomes that fluctuate 
        based on customer generosity rather than standardized pay. Many service employees struggle with financial 
        insecurity by relying on tips, making it difficult to budget or plan for expenses.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The essay also explores the biases embedded in tipping culture. Studies show that tipping is often influenced 
        by factors unrelated to service quality, such as race, gender, and appearance, leading to disparities in earnings. 
        This system perpetuates discrimination, as workers who do not fit customers’ implicit biases may receive lower tips 
        despite providing the same level of service.

        Additionally, the video addresses the burden tipping places on customers. In the U.S., tipping is expected in most 
        service interactions, often with pressure to tip generously even when service is subpar. As tip prompts increase on 
        digital payment systems, many consumers feel obligated to leave higher tips, even in fast-casual settings where tipping 
        is unexpected.

    <p>
        The essay incorporates worker testimonials, economic research, and global comparisons to support its argument. 
        In countries that have eliminated tipping in favor of a service charge or higher base wages, restaurant employees 
        benefit from stable incomes, and customers are not responsible for subsidizing wages. Examining these models, 
        the video challenges the idea that tipping is necessary for good service.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ultimately, the essay argues that moving toward a no-tip, fair-wage system would create a more equitable and 
        sustainable restaurant industry. Standardized wages would ensure financial stability for workers, reduce biases, 
        and relieve customers of the expectation to supplement wages, leading to a fairer dining experience.
