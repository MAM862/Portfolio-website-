    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This audio narrative offers a candid and reflective look into the balancing act of being a full-time student while juggling the responsibilities of part-time work and a professional internship. Through personal storytelling and genuine conversations, the project highlights the complexities and emotional ups and downs that come with managing multiple roles. 
      <p>Listeners are invited into a space where academic pressures, job expectations, and internship lessons collide sometimes gracefully, often chaotically.

Each episode unpacks real experiences around topics like time management strategies that actually work (or dont), the quiet toll of burnout, the anxiety of meeting deadlines, and the unexpected personal growth that often comes from being stretched too thin. <p>With humor and honesty, the narrative doesnt shy away from the messy realities like crying in stairwells or pulling all-nighters but it also celebrates the small wins, like mastering a calendar or finally feeling confident in a professional setting.

More than just a personal journal, this podcast aims to resonate with students and early-career professionals who are navigating similar paths. Its a reminder that while the struggle is real, so is the resilience. And sometimes, laughter and shared stories are the best tools we have to keep going.
