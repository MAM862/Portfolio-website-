        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Building this website challenged me to think carefully about structure, design, and accessibility. Although the code itself is relatively simple, every decision from creating a clear navigation bar to linking different pages required a thoughtful approach to user experience. It pushed me to balance creativity with clarity, ensuring that visitors could easily understand and explore my work without feeling overwhelmed or confused.</p>

        <p>Composing the digital projects throughout the course, like the audio narrative and video essay, taught me the importance of planning and revision. In traditional writing, it's easy to add, delete, or rearrange text. In digital media, every choice, from sound effects to editing cuts, needs to be intentional because it affects not only the message but also the emotional tone and pacing. This made me appreciate the drafting process in a new way, especially when creating multimedia content.</p>

        <p>Another important part of the process was learning to adapt to new technologies and formats. Every project pushed me to experiment with different tools and think outside the traditional essay structure. Whether learning basic HTML/CSS or editing audio files, the technical skills I developed gave me a broader understanding of how to communicate effectively in digital spaces.</p>

        <p>Overall, composing for this course helped me grow as a communicator, not just as a writer. I learned that composing digitally involves not just "writing," but also designing, curating, and thinking strategically about how different media work together to create a larger impact. I now feel more confident entering future projects where flexibility and digital literacy are key expectations.</p>
